# A BlackJack game simulation app!

This web project simulates the game of ***BlackJack***. It's made from scratch by simply using ***Javascript*** and a little of ***CSS*** for styling.
The cool thing is that the app simulates a real deck that throws and remove cards. 
When deck is empty, cards are re-shuffled (a simple alert notifies the user)

**With this app you can practice your card counting skills without getting arrested! (I hope...) See on [this link](https://monumental-cuchufli-cbe520.netlify.app/) and try to yourself!**
