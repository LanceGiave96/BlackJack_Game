# A BlackJack game simulation app! ♦ ♠ ♣ ♥ 🃏

This web project simulates the game of ***BlackJack***. It's made from scratch by simply using ***Javascript*** and a little of ***CSS*** for styling ​💻.
The cool thing is that the app simulates a real deck that throws and remove cards 🤩​. 
When deck is empty, cards are re-shuffled (a simple alert notifies the user 🧑‍💻​)

**With this app you can practice your card counting skills without getting arrested! (I hope...😅) See on [this link](https://monumental-cuchufli-cbe520.netlify.app/) and try to yourself! 💪​**
